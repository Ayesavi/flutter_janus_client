Deprecation Notice:- Version 2 of flutter_janus_client is almost ready! current version that is 0.0.4(master branch) is unstable and difficult to maintain and will soon be deprecated,
if you planning to use janus_client  in production or just experimenting it is highly recommended to switch to v2 branch or directly use latest beta release from [pub.dev/janus_client_2.x.x-beta](https://pub.dev/packages/janus_client/versions/2.1.1-beta)
until v2 branch is merged into master
